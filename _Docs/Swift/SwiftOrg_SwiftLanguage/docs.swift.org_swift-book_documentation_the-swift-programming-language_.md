[Functions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/functions)

Define and call functions, label their arguments, and use their return values.

[Closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/closures)

Group code that executes together, without creating a named function.

[Enumerations](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/enumerations)

Model custom types that define a list of possible values.

[Structures and Classes](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/classesandstructures)

Model custom types that encapsulate data.

[Properties](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties)

Access stored and computed values that are part of an instance or type.

[Methods](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/methods)

Define and call functions that are part of an instance or type.

[Subscripts](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/subscripts)

Access the elements of a collection.

[Inheritance](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/inheritance)

Subclass to add or override functionality.

[Initialization](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/initialization)

Set the initial values for a type’s stored properties and perform one-time setup.

[Deinitialization](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/deinitialization)

Release resources that require custom cleanup.

[Optional Chaining](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/optionalchaining)

Use macros to generate code at compile time.

[Type Casting](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/typecasting)

Determine a value’s runtime type and give it more specific type information.

[Nested Types](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/nestedtypes)

Define types inside the scope of another type.

[Extensions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/extensions)

Hide implementation details about a value’s type.

[Automatic Reference Counting](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/automaticreferencecounting)

Model the lifetime of objects and their relationships.

[Memory Safety](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/memorysafety)

Structure your code to avoid conflicts when accessing memory.

[Access Control](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/accesscontrol)

Manage the visibility of code by declaration, file, and module.

[Advanced Operators](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/advancedoperators)
